WHO WE ARE



Andrew & Calum started Bike Tailor to help students get a better deal when searching for a bike. We know students are time poor and buying a bike can be daunting. We make it easy by making just three recommendations (and no pressure to purchase). 



Andrew and Calum both graduated in 2013 from St Andrews and Cambridge respectively.
